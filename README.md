BasicTemplates
==============

This repository contains basic information to standardize code writing and code documentation.


Most used coding standards:

- Matlab http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/creed/Spring2011/pdf/matlab-guidelines.pdf
- R http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml
- Python http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
- Fortran http://fortran90.org/src/best-practices.html


For code documentation, the general suggestion is to use a doxygen-like approach, to extracts automatically comments from your files to generate documentation. 

Refer to DOXYGEN website (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html), if you program in one of the following languages: C, Objective-C, C#, PHP, Java, Python, Fortran...even Matlab (http://www.mathworks.co.uk/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25925-using-doxygen-with-matlab).

If you program in R, then use ROXYGEN2 (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/).


A basic template is attached. Happy coding!
